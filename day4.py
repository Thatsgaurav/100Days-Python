## Heads or Tails

# Instructions

# You are going to write a virtual coin toss program. It will randomly tell the user "Heads" or "Tails". 

# **Important**, the first letter should be capitalised and spelt exactly like in the example e.g. Heads, not heads.

# There are many ways of doing this. But to practice what we learnt in the last lesson, you should generate a random number, either 0 or 1. Then use that number to print out Heads or Tails.

# e.g.
# 1 means Heads
# 0 means Tails 

# Example Output

# ```
# Heads
# ```

# or

# ```
# Tails
# ```

# import random

# random_side = random.randint(0, 1)
# if random_side == 1:
#   print("Heads")
# else:
#   print("Tails")

# Instructions
# You are going to write a program which will select a random name from a list of names. 
# The person selected will have to pay for everybody's food bill.

# Important: You are not allowed to use the choice() function.

# Line 8 splits the string names_string into individual names and puts them inside a List 
# called names. For this to work, you must enter all the names as name followed by comma 
# then space. e.g. name, name, name
